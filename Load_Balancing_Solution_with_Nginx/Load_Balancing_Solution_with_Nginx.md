# Load-Balancer_Solution_With_Nginx

* By now we have learned what Load Balancing is used for and have configured an LB solution using Apache, but a DevOps engineer must be a versatile professional and know different alternative solutions for the same problem.That is why, in this project we will configure an Nginx Load Balancer solution.

* It is also extremely important to ensure that connections to Web solutions are secure and information is encrypted in transit - we will also cover connection over secured HTTP (HTTPS protocol), its purpose and what is required to implement it.

* When data is moving between a client (browser) and a Web Server over the Internet - it passes through multiple network devices and, if the data is not encrypted, it can be relatively easy intercepted by someone who has 
access to the intermediate equipment. This kind of information security threat is called Man-In-The-Middle (MIMT) attack.

* This threat is real - users that share sensitive information (bank details, social media access credentials, etc.) via non-secured channels, risk their data to be compromised and used by cybercriminals.

* SSL and its newer version, TSL - is a security technology that protects connection from MITM attacks by creating an encrypted session between browser and Web server. Here we will refer this family of cryptographic protocols as SSL/TLS - even though SSL was replaced by TLS, the term is still being widely used.

* SSL/TLS uses digital certificates to identify and validate a Website. A browser reads the certificate issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) to make sure that the website is registered in the CA so it can be trusted to establish a secured connection.

* There are different types of SSL/TLS certificates - we can learn more about them here. We can also watch a tutorial on how SSL works here or an additional resource hereIn this project you will register website with LetsEnrcypt Certificate Authority, to automate certificate issuance we will use a shell client recommended by LetsEncrypt - cetrbot.


## Task

This project consists of two parts:
1. Configure Nginx as a Load Balancer.
2. Register a new domain name and configure secured connection using SSL/TLS certificates.

Target architecture will look like:

## Part 1: Configure Nginx as a Load Balancer

1. Set Up Nginx on an EC2 Instance:

* Create an EC2 VM based on Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS, and name it .

* Open TCP port 80 for HTTP connections.

* Open TCP port 443 for HTTPS connections.

* Update the /etc/hosts file for local DNS with the web servers' names (e.g., Web1, Web2) and their local IP addresses.

2. Install and Configure Nginx as a Load Balancer.

* Update the system and install Nginx:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

* Open the Nginx configuration file:

```
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

* Insert the following configuration into the http section:

```
upstream myproject {
    server Web1 weight=5;
    server Web2 weight=5;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://myproject;
    }
}
```
Comment out this line: ```# include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;```

3. Restart Nginx to apply the changes:

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

## Part 2: Register a Domain and Configure SSL/TLS Certificates

1. Register a Domain Name using any domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Bluehost).

![image 7](https://github.com/Captnfresh/Load-Balancer_Solution_With_Nginx/blob/main/LBS%20with%20Nginx%20and%20SSL%20and%20TLS/image%207.jpg)

2. Assign an Elastic IP to your Nginx server and associate your domain name with this Elastic IP.

3. Follow the guide below to allocate an Elastic IP and associate it with your EC2 instance.

![image 8](https://github.com/Captnfresh/Load-Balancer_Solution_With_Nginx/blob/main/LBS%20with%20Nginx%20and%20SSL%20and%20TLS/image%208.jpg)

4. Update the A record in your domain registrar to point to the Elastic IP of your Nginx server.

5. Update your Nginx configuration file:

```
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf 
```

6. Change the server_name value to your new domain:

```
server_name www.<your-domain-name>.com;
```

7. Restart Nginx to apply the changes:

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Step 3: Install Certbot and Request an SSL Certificate

1. Ensure the snapd service is active:
```
sudo systemctl status snapd
```
2. Install Certbot:
```
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```

3. Request an SSL certificate:

```
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Test secured access to your website by visiting `https://<your-domain-name>.com`.

## Step 4: Set Up SSL/TLS Certificate Renewal

1. Test the certificate renewal command:
```
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

2. Set up a cron job to renew the SSL certificate automatically:
```
crontab -e
```

3. Add the following line to schedule certificate renewal twice a day:

```
* */12 * * * root /usr/bin/certbot renew > /dev/null 2>&1
```

We have now successfuly configured a Nginx based Load Balancer for our webservers, ensured it can be accessed by a domain name and has SSL installed for security.

# Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how to set up a load balancer using Nginx to distribute traffic across multiple web servers. It's designed to improve the performance and reliability of web applications by evenly distributing incoming requests.

## Architecture: The setup includes:
1. Two or more backend web servers (Apache in this case)

2. One Nginx server acting as a load balancer

3. Implementation Steps:

   a. Provisioning EC2 Instances:
   * Create EC2 instances for web servers and the load balancer
   * Configure security groups to allow necessary traffic
 
   b. Installing and Configuring Web Servers:
   * Install Apache web server on the backend instances
   * Configure Apache to serve a sample web page

   c. Setting up Nginx as Load Balancer:
   * Install Nginx on the load balancer instance
   * Configure Nginx to distribute traffic to the backend servers

   d. Testing the Setup:
   * Verify that the load balancer is correctly distributing requests
   * Test failover scenarios by stopping one of the web servers
