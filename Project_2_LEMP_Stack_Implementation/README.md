## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (MERN STACK) IN AWS

### INTRODUCTION:

### What is the MERN stack?
The 
***MERN stack***
 is a web development framework made up of the stack of MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node.js. It is one of the several variants of the 
MEAN stack.

***MERN***  Stands For:

- M- MongoDB
- E- ExpressJS
- R-ReactJS
- N-Node.js

When you use the MERN stack, you work with React to implement the presentation layer, 
Express and Node.js to make up the middle or application layer, and MongoDB to create the database layer.

In this MERN stack tutorial, we will utilize these four technologies to develop a basic **To-Do  application** that is able to create a to-do list.

### Setting up the project

MERN lets us create full-stack solutions. 
So, to leverage its full potential, we will be creating a MERN stack project. For this project, we will create both a back end and a front end. 
The front end will be implemented with React and the back end will be implemented with MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. We will call the front end client and the back end server.
