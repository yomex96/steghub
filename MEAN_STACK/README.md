## Web Stack Implementation (MEAN Stack) on AWS

### Introduction

### What is the MEAN Stack?

The MEAN stack is a JavaScript-based framework designed for building scalable web applications. "MEAN" stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node, representing the core technologies used in the stack:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL, object-oriented database optimized for cloud applications.
  
- **Express.js**: A lightweight web framework for Node.js that facilitates communication between the front end (client) and the backend database.
  
- **Angular**: A powerful client-side JavaScript framework used to develop dynamic web applications with interactive user interfaces.
  
- **Node.js**: A leading JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable network applications and servers.

### Benefits of the MEAN Stack

The MEAN stack offers a cross-platform, write-once approach, making it versatile for various applications. It is especially well-suited for real-time applications, cloud-native systems, and single-page applications (SPAs) built with Angular. Some common use cases include:

- Workflow management systems.
  
- News aggregation platforms.
  
- To-do list and calendar apps.
  
- Interactive discussion forums.

### Setting Up the Project

For this project, we'll implement a simple Book Registration web form using the MEAN stack on AWS.
