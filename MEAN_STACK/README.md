## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (MEAN STACK) IN AWS

### INTRODUCTION:

### What is the MEAN stack?

The MEAN stack is a JavaScript-based framework for developing scalable web applications. The term MEAN is an acronym for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node — the four key technologies that make up the layers of the technology stack.

- MongoDB: A NoSQL, object-oriented database designed for use with cloud applications.
  
- Express(.js): A web application framework for Node(.js) that supports interactions between the front end (e.g., the client side) and the database.
  
- Angular(.js): Often referred to as the “front end"; a client-side JavaScript framework used to create dynamic web applications to work with interactive user interfaces.
  
- Node(.js): The premier JavaScript web server used to build scalable network applications.

### Advantages of the MEAN stack
MEAN applications can be used in many ways with a cross-platform write-once approach. While MEAN is particularly suited to real-time applications, particularly those running natively in the cloud and single-page (dynamic) web applications built in Angular.js, it can be used for other use cases, such as:

- Workflow management tools.
  
- News aggregation sites.
  
- Todo and calendar applications.
  
- Interactive forums.

  ### Setting up the project
For this project, we are going to implement a simple Book Register web form using MEAN stack.
