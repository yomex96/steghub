## Web Stack Implementation (MEAN Stack) on AWS

### Introduction

### What is the MEAN Stack?

The MEAN stack is a JavaScript-based framework designed for building scalable web applications. "MEAN" stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node, representing the core technologies used in the stack:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL, object-oriented database optimized for cloud applications.
  
- **Express.js**: A lightweight web framework for Node.js that facilitates communication between the front end (client) and the backend database.
  
- **Angular**: A powerful client-side JavaScript framework used to develop dynamic web applications with interactive user interfaces.
  
- **Node.js**: A leading JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable network applications and servers.
